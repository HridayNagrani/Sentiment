            "After a few years of frustrating cost-cutting and hesitant spending, Boston finally a way forward. Rafael Devers ranks second in the majors with 1,078 total bases over the last four seasons.Brian Fluharty/USA TODAY Sports In a vacuum, Rafael Devers’s 11-year, $331-million extension with the Red Sox is a smart move to retain one of the brightest third basemen in the game. But in context? It feels like something bigger. The Devers extension seems almost essential: a move by the Red Sox to show they do have a sense of competitive direction right now, and they’ll still pay what it takes to retain one of their young stars, despite recent evidence to the contrary. Devers was previously scheduled to hit free agency after this season. The extension is the largest—and longest—contract guarantee in the history of the franchise and will keep the 26-year-old in Boston through 2033. The Red Sox had plenty of reasons to be interested in keeping Devers. He’s established himself as one of the sharpest young talents in the game. After being called up at age 20 in 2017, Devers won a World Series with Boston in ’18, and he enjoyed a breakout season in ’19. He’s since had consistent success—a capable left-handed hitter who’s become a regular down-ballot candidate for MVP. Devers is one of just 26 hitters to accumulate at least 14.0 Baseball-Reference WAR since ’19, and notably, he is the youngest player in that set. He’s coming off a strong season where he upgraded his defense and had a career best performance at the plate with a 141 OPS+. (Though it’s worth noting that even with his defensive improvements, his long-term fate might be at first base or as a designated hitter, rather than at third.) It also helps that he’s traditionally been very durable. Devers has made just one trip to the injured list over the past four seasons. (The 10-day IL trip for hamstring inflammation came last summer and did not last any longer than the minimum required.) There are only six players who have taken more plate appearances than Devers since ’19. In short, he’s young, talented and healthy; Boston had every reason to believe he should be a core part of their offense for years to come. And that’s especially pressing given the position of the franchise right now. The Red Sox are coming off a last-place finish in which they looked completely uncompetitive in the AL East. Their overall strategy last year appeared uncertain—particularly after a trade deadline where they seemed unwilling to commit to one particular direction—and their offseason had previously not positioned them any better. They reportedly missed out on several free agents. They’d made a few modest upgrades—Kenley Jansen and Chris Martin for the bullpen, Corey Kluber for the rotation, and Justin Turner and outfielder Masataka Yoshida for the offense—but, with the exception of Yoshida’s five-year contract, all were short-term deals. The big question here was what the Red Sox would do long term: Were they interested in retaining Devers, the only big piece remaining from the core that won them their most recent title? Would they be willing to spend big to do so? Their recent track record of keeping young stars was not good. The Padres outbid Boston for franchise shortstop and de facto captain Xander Bogaerts this winter. That disappointment came after the Red Sox had traded Mookie Betts to the Dodgers in February 2020 for a package that has not exactly covered itself in glory in the years since. Jeter Downs, the top prospect in the deal, was designated for assignment last month; meanwhile, Betts agreed to a 12-year extension with the Dodgers a few months after the trade and then led Los Angeles to a World Series title in his first season with the team. Money was clearly the motivating factor behind the Betts trade, as Boston attached veteran lefthander David Price to dump his salary and get under the luxury tax threshold. The problem for the Red Sox, aside from trading their best player during his prime instead of paying him what he was worth, was they didn’t use the resulting financial flexibility wisely. Before leaving Beantown for the NL West, Betts and Bogaerts were supposed to be the cornerstones of the franchise for years to come. Their departures made it all the more important for Boston to keep Devers. There are some bright spots coming from this farm system. But Devers is the only young player with a proven track record in the major leagues and the obvious potential to be the face of the franchise. To let him go would have been a rather damning statement about the team’s long-term vision. To extend him was the opposite. Known primarily for his bat, Devers greatly improved his defense in 2022.Wendell Cruz/USA TODAY Sports The Red Sox paid handsomely to do so. Devers’s 11-year deal is almost $120 million more than Austin Riley’s 12-year, $212 million extension with the Braves. But they would have likely needed to pay even more if they had tried to re-sign him on the open market after he hit free agency next winter. Given the franchise’s current position, it was worth paying what it took to keep Devers, and while any long-term deal like this is something of a gamble, his steadiness and good health so far suggest only good things. The extension doesn’t change anything about the upcoming season: The Red Sox were not set up to be great before the deal, and because Devers was always going to be part of this roster for 2023, they’re not set up to be any better after it. But this is about the long term, not the short term, and this indicates their willingness to be competitive for the former. How well-situated they’ll look for ’24 and beyond will depend partially on how the top of this farm system develops. Will top prospects like Triston Casas and Marcelo Mayer find quick success while joining Devers in this infield? If not, will the Red Sox be willing to pivot and invest in other areas of the roster? But regardless of what the future holds, this was the clearest, most positive statement they could have made about their intentions: After a few years of frustrating cost-cutting and hesitant spending, the Devers extension shows the Red Sox are once again committed to winning.\n",

Billy might take it but I’m warning you Phil, I’m not scared of you.  “And if I have to take you on then I will because I will protect my family until there’s not one breath left in my body.” Reeling from the confrontation with Honey, Phil went home and Kat was left to deal with. She raged at Phil for putting her and her boys in danger. In a rare display of emotion, Phil was in tears as he told Kat that she means everything to him – and he begged her to stay. Meanwhile in the hospital, Keanu listened in as Keeble kept to her promise and pretended she had no idea who shot her. But viewers aren’t impressed. One wrote: “Keeble doing the right thing – wonders never cease.” A second said: “After all that, all Keeble and Phil needed was a cuppa tea and a deep meaningful conversation.” But others were glad to see the back of Keeble, with one writing: “It’s finally over.”\n",

According to Ms. James’ office, over $440 million was put by over 26,000 New Yorkers into the insolvent Celsius Network as of December 31, 2021. Ms. James is suing Mashinsky for monetary damages and an injunction barring him from engaging in any activity in New York related to the sale or issue of securities or commodities. She also wants to make it such the former CEO can’t work for any state-based companies in any capacity. At the time of its introduction in 2017, Alex Mashinsky promoted Celsius as a safe and risk-free way to put money to work. Over the span of five years, the firm went from obscurity to becoming one of the leading crypto lenders and a custodian of over $20 billion in assets.

            "If you're new to the short-term rental industry, you may find launching an Airbnb business quite challenging. The ins and outs of the business may confuse you, and you might even get scared to go further, especially if you don't have properties to use for your listing. But just like any enterprise, Airbnb is learnable. And there are tricks you can use to start and thrive in the business. I'm sharing four of the most powerful tips I have in my arsenal so you can use them to create your own Airbnb business . Related: 4 Reasons Why Short-Term Rentals are the Future of the World Economy Using whatever resources you have is better than waiting before making a move. To illustrate this, I want to share my experience when I first started with Airbnb in 2017. During the first few years before launching, I didn't have much. I knew I wanted a property rental business but could only afford rent. I did find my first rentals: a tiny two-bedroom and a one-bathroom unit that weren't in ideal neighborhoods. These properties were also very basic. They didn't have pools or game rooms, and nothing was special about them. The only edge they probably had over other Airbnb units in the same area was that they were cheaper to rent. That was the best I could do at that time, but I still started anyway. Now I have more properties, which are way better than the ones I had when I first started. I've also earned my first million with them. Lesson: Don't stress too much about getting everything perfect. Just focus on moving forward. \"Bad company corrupts good character.\" This famous adage reminds us to be selective about who we keep in our lives. As humans who love companionship, we want to be with other people. But this also means we are easily influenced by who we are with. If you're constantly around people who love to gamble, you'll eventually want to gamble with them too. If your friends don't have plans to grow, you won't be motivated to improve either. By the same token, if you want to succeed, you must be with people who understand your mindset. It's better to find people who are more successful than you. Because when you stick with them and follow their advice, you'll be at the same level as they are and will continue to seek growth. Related: 10 Powerful Attributes of Insanely Successful People Planning for the near future is great, but thinking further will give you a better head start. For example, someone came to you to sell their property. It's an abandoned house at the end of the street. And they're selling it to you for a much lower price because you're a friend and they're in a hurry to get the money. And you happen to have just the amount (although it's originally for your dream vacation). Your family says it's a bad decision because the property is pretty much useless. But you're thinking otherwise. As someone who thinks ahead and focuses on long-term effects, you decide to buy it. Then you renovate it so you can use it for Airbnb. Now you have a passive income business that lets you earn even while on vacation, and you'll even get to enjoy it for the years to come! This is what thinking ahead means. Related: Franchise the Unexpected: 4 Franchisors Thinking Ahead Want to launch a business but lack the budget? Start looking for people, banks or institutions that can lend you some! In the business world, this is a legitimate strategy called \" leveraging ,\" and it's how the rich get richer. Most people base their potential on the capital they have. \"No money = no business.\" But resourceful people don't follow this rule. For them, \"no money\" means looking for those who have it and getting them to sign a deal so they can use it as capital. Related: How to Start a Business With No Money They can always pay off the debt with the initial profits. Once it's paid, they live off an already established business that they now completely own. Of course, this is a very simplistic explanation; there's more to it than meets the eye. But leveraging is an excellent option if you really want to get started. Since we're already on the topic, did you know you can use the same technique for your Airbnb business? If you don't own properties to list and don't have enough money to buy one, why not look for people who do? This is a strategy called Rental Arbitrage , also known as subleasing . It's where you look for properties for rent, get in touch with their landlord, and ask them if you can use their property for your short-term rental business. If they say yes, you sign a lease, and you're good to go! So are you ready to get that Airbnb business launched and expanded? Practice these four powerful tips and use them to create your own successful Airbnb business now and in the years to come.

            "The contagion spreading from the collapsed FTX crypto exchange has reached crypto exchange Gemini, which was founded by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in 2014. Gemini lent $900 million of client funds to a crypto investment firm and now it wants its money back by Sunday to resolve the liquidity crisis facing its 340,000 customers who have money stuck in its lending product, Gemini Earn. Gemini offered users yields as high as 8 percent through its lending product Gemini Earn. To generate those returns, Gemini lent users’ funds to Genesis Global Capital, the lending arm of crypto investment firm Genesis Global Trading, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). Genesis in turn loaned funds out to institutional borrowers. DCG also owns news publication Coindesk, and Grayscale. A troubled digital asset manager, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is trading at a 45-percent discount to the price of its underlying asset despite Bitcoin trading at multiyear lows, Ryan Browne wrote for CNBC. Gemini wants its $900 million of client funds back that it lent Genesis to generate yields for its interest-bearing Gemini Earn accounts, CNBC reported. After FTX filed for bankruptcy, Gemini paused redemptions for Gemini Earn as Genesis Global Capital also suspended new loan originations and stopped issuing redemptions to clients. In an open letter, Winklevoss accused Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert of diverting $1.6 billion of Genesis money that should have been used to pay Gemini Earn customers to other parts of DCG’s crypto empire, and engaging in “bad faith stalling tactics.” Earn Update: An Open Letter to @BarrySilbert pic.twitter.com/kouAviTho4— Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) January 2, 2023 Gemini has denied any exposure to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, but Genesis said in a Nov. 10 tweet that its derivatives business has about $175 million in funds locked inside FTX, according to CNBC. “For the past six weeks, we have done everything we can to engage with you in a good faith and collaborative manner in order to reach a consensual resolution for you to pay back the $900 million that you owe, while helping you preserve your business,” Winklevoss said in the letter, which was tweeted publicly Monday. “We appreciate that there are startup costs to any restructuring, and at times things don’t go as fast as we would all like. However, it is now becoming clear that you have been engaging in bad faith stall tactics.” Winklevoss accused Silbert of hiding behind behind “lawyers, investment bankers, and process,” adding, “After six weeks, your behavior is not only completely unacceptable, it is unconscionable.” He also alleged that Digital Currency Group and Genesis are “beyond commingled.” Digital Currency Group (DCG) owes Genesis $1.675 billion which includes a $575 million liability due in May 2023, and a $1.1 billion promissory note Genesis issued to Three Arrows Capital, which DCG absorbed following the crypto hedge fund’s collapse in 2022. The first major crypto firm to go bankrupt in 2022, Three Arrows was dragged down by the collapse of cryptocurrencies Luna and TerraUSD. It filed for bankruptcy in the British Virgin Islands in June. “This is money that Genesis owes to (Gemini) Earn users and other creditors,” Winkelvoss wrote. “You took this money — the money of schoolteachers — to fuel greedy share buybacks, illiquid venture investments, and kamikaze Grayscale NAV (net asset value) trades that ballooned the fee-generating AUM (assets under management) of your Trust; all at the expense of creditors and all for your own personal gain.” In response to Winklevoss’ tweet, Silbert denied that DCG borrowed $1.675 billion from Genesis. “DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; next loan maturity is May 2023,” he added. “DCG delivered to Genesis and your advisors a proposal on December 29th and has not received any response.” Winklevoss said he wants to resolve the liquidity crunch by Sunday, Jan. 8. “We remain ready and willing to work with you, but time is running out,” he said. Genesis told clients in late 2021 it may need to file for bankruptcy if its fundraising efforts fail to fill a hole left by FTX exposure fail, Bloomberg reported. In a recent update, the company said it believes it can arrive at a solution. Genesis interim CEO Derar Islim said that while the company is “committed to moving as quickly as possible, this is a very complex process that will take some additional time.” The post Crypto Bosses In Multibillion-Dollar Public Dispute Over Missing Customer Funds appeared first on Moguldom.\n",

ITVWhat’s in store or Abi Webster in 2023?[/caption] ITVThe mechanic has had to handle a lot of hardship in recent months[/caption] ITVThis most notably resulted in a death in the cobbles[/caption] Recent months have been particularly hard for the mechanic played by Sally Carman. Fortunately for her, she finally managed to prove she was a fit mother for her son Alfie, whom she unexpectedly gave birth to following a one night stand with the late Imran Habeeb. Abi’s life in Weatherfield has since remained quiet as she reconnected with her husband Kevin Webster (portrayed by Michael Le Vell). Speaking to The Sun, Corrie boss Iain MacLeod revealed Abi’s break from all the turmoil will be coming to an end, although she’s set for “happiness more than sadness.” In 2023, Abi will take on a bystander role as she’s embroiled in another storyline. “She becomes a key confidante to one of the youngsters in the big socially responsible issue story”, Iain said. “She becomes a surrogate mum and has big dilemmas aboutwhose version of events she believes and who she sides with.” More importantly, Abi will have to face her own chaotic past with addiction. “This causes her to investigate her own history of substance misuse over the years”, Iain added. But that’s not all – Abi will also reconnect with her past with the help of an old friend who rocks up the cobbles. And viewers may be surprised as the character “transpires to be the last possible person you’d expect to find in herbackstory.” Overall, fans of the Manchester-based drama will be treated to “an odd couple story” as Abi’s old pal is her “polar opposite.” CORONATION STREET NEWS Everything you need to know about Coronation Street New, leaving and returning Coronation Street cast The filming locations for Coronation Street revealed All the latest Coronation Street spoilers Coronation Street’s best bits One thing is almost certain, the new storyline will be a stark contrast with the heavy plots Abi has been involved in 2022. These involved an intense custody battle for Alfie as well as a shocking death. Prior to this, Abi was heartbroken when her son Seb died after a brutal assault. “We are very keen to see her happy”, Iain continued. “She must have felt rung out by the end of all those big stories I’d be surprised if there were any tears left!” “She’s been through such tragedy.” Yet Abi’s life in the cobbles won’t ever be without drama as bosses don’t want her or Kevin to get too comfortable.

            "PRIME drink is being resold online for ten times the original price as intense demand has sparked Brits into a frenzy. The £1.99 drink, created and marketed by YouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul, has been advertised on the web for vastly inflated prices. Simon JonesPrime is being resold online for ten times the original price as Brits descended into a buying frenzy[/caption] Prime has become the first “viral drink” and is in ever-increasing demand in UK shops. And on Facebook Marketplace, bottles are being offered for 10 times the original price tag. One seller in Penarth, Wales, is selling Prime – Ice Pop and Meta Moon flavours – for £25 a bottle, with another in Swansea advertising it at £20 each. Elsewhere, in Cardiff, bottles are being touted at £50 for four, while one vendor in Newport is listing it for £9 a bottle. Prime has seen shoppers queuing for hours to nab the drinks containing mostly water added with vitamins and minerals, with few calories and no added sugar.  Advertised as a “hydration drink” it is also made up of coconut water but does not have any caffeine in it. The drink is so hot among youngsters that desperate parents have travelled more than 500 miles just to get their hands on a bottle. Supermarkets have even seen stampedes of customers and parents wrestling kids out of the way to get their hands on a bottle. The drink sold out “in seconds” when it hit shelves in Aldi last week and had to be rationed to one of each flavour per customer. One Aldi staff member told PlymouthLive that their store had sold 360 bottles in under six minutes. Meanwhile, there was shocking footage of adults pushing young children out of the way at an Aldi in Sydenham, East London to try and get hold of just a few bottles. It comes after news that a new version of the viral drink will soon be hitting our shore – but not without a catch. Prime’s popularity grew after YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI promoted the drink around high-profile celebrity boxing bouts in the UK. The duo came up with the idea for coconut water-based Prime Hydration after their final boxing match in 2019. During a live stream, the pair said they wanted to “rival the biggest companies on earth” with their products – including “Pepsi, Coke, Gatorade and Powerade”.\n",

            "Second-half predictions as the league approaches the midway point.With the calendar turning to 2023 and the NBA season approaching its midway point, here are our second-half predictions.1. The Lakers will make a trade, but pull the trigger too late for it to matter.If you’d been tasked with guessing the Lakers’ two most likely problems heading into the season, it wouldn’t have been surprising if you’d landed on the lack of perimeter shooting, and the fact that Anthony Davis was likely to suffer an injury that keeps him shelved for significant time. Both those things have come to pass, with Los Angeles’s shooting dreadfully from deep, and Davis’s being out. I’d guess the Lakers will try something via the trade market at some point. But if they do, it’d almost be disappointing that they waited so long. —Chris Herring2. The league will adopt a new CBA—without any drama.We’ve had 11 years of labor peace since the nasty lockout of 2011. That streak isn’t ending now, despite whatever posturing you’ve heard about a “hard” salary cap and other obnoxious CBA verbiage. The fact is, the league is in fantastic shape, both competitively and financially, and it would be patently insane to risk a lockout (or strike) now, especially with a fat new media-rights deal on the horizon. Also, both the league (under commissioner Adam Silver) and the union (under executive director Tamika Tremaglio) are now led by diplomats, not pugilists. They’ll find a way to extend the current deal, with some notable changes they both want (e.g. abolishing the age limit). —Howard Beck3. At least one team aggressively trades into losing.The much-ballyhooed tank race happens. Just give it a little more time. The Jazz, Thunder, Raptors and Bulls are among the teams I’m watching closely. —Jeremy Woo4. Karl-Anthony Towns will be traded.It can’t happen until July 1 (due to CBA rules), but it’s going to happen, barring some miracle turnaround in Minneapolis. Towns has been the Timberwolves’ centerpiece for nearly eight seasons now. They’ve made the playoffs twice, and been bounced in the first round both times. The Rudy Gobert trade was supposed to fix things. It hasn’t. The Wolves can command a small ransom for KAT, and use the pieces to rebuild around Gobert and Anthony Edwards. —Beck5. The Kings will make the playoffs!I repeat: The Kings, that cursed franchise in California’s capital, will make the playoffs! In the NBA! This spring! I know, this doesn’t seem like a very ambitious prediction, with the Kings currently, firmly in playoff contention, but that ignores all the other moments of fleeting hopes and false promise since 2006 (their last time in the postseason). That record drought ends in April, even if it means getting in via the play-in round. Light the beam! —Beck6a. The Grizzlies will come out of the WestAs we look at the convoluted standings in the Western Conference, things have been highly strange. But one thing makes sense: The Grizzlies are showing that last year was anything but a fluke, sitting in first place despite a number of injuries. They’re a great bet to come out of the West if they’re healthy. —Herring6b. No, the Clippers will win the WestWith all due respect to every other would-be Western Conference contender, I’m buying-in on the Clippers. Everything is contingent on Kawhi Leonard’s knee holding up but if it does, this team won’t just beat everyone in the West—they might blow right through them. —Chris Mannix6c. No, actually, the Nuggets will win the West—and the NBA Finals.Nikola Jokić is playing at an MVP level for the third straight season, and the team finally has the requisite depth to win in the playoffs thanks to the returns of Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. In a season so far defined by parity, the Nuggets have the trump card in the Joker and will take advantage of a superteam vacuum at the top. —Rohan NadkarniWatch NBA games live with fuboTV: Start a free trial today.7. Victor Wembanyama becomes the No. 1 pick in June.For some reason I feel really good about this one. Not sure why. Just have a feeling this one is coming true. —Woo8. The Pistons will win the top pick, and become an Eastern Conference power by 2025It would make all too much sense if the Pistons grow strong again at the same time that the Celtics and Cavaliers are right near the top of the East. And that could be the reality if Detroit—without Cade Cunningham for the rest of the season, and giving plentiful reps to rookie Jaden Ivey and the suddenly improving Killian Hayes—lands the top pick. With Victor Wembanyama, the Motor City would have one of the most formidable young trios, and that’d be on top of Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey (who’s come up in trade rumors) and Jalen Duren, the league’s youngest player and one who has an incredibly bright future. —Herring9. Kyrie Irving will be a Laker (finally)The Nets seem content (resigned?) to finish this season with their current core, including the perpetual distraction in the No. 11 jersey. But this is now an all-or-nothing campaign. Unless the Nets win it all, it’s hard to see them re-signing Irving next summer. It’s also hard to see much of a market for him, given his recent history. We do know LeBron James would welcome a reunion, though. —Beck10. LeBron James will be tradedLet’s face it: James’s decision to extend his contract with the Lakers was a mistake. James doesn’t need the guaranteed cash and, in pushing his deal through ’23–24, limited his leverage. LA didn’t have the pieces to build a title contender around James and doesn’t have the flexibility (this season, anyway) to do anything with him. In an ideal world, the Lakers use the cap space created by Russell Westbrook’s exit next summer to sign Kyrie Irving or Draymond Green, flip a draft pick or two and vault back into contention next season. But if that doesn’t happen, can the Lakers really go into ’23 with James, Anthony Davis and whatever cast of castoffs they can assemble around them? Would James want to? Dealing James would take some chutzpah, but if LA whiffs on big-ticket items next offseason, is there really a better choice? —Mannix\n",

TikTok user Alexi McKinley joked that her everyday look qualified her as a catfish in comparison to her natural skin. aleximckinley/TikTokTikTok user Alexi McKinley shared the dramatic transformation that happens when she puts on makeup[/caption] aleximckinley/TikTokThe self-described catfish shared a video in which she removed her makeup at the end of the day[/caption] In her video, the blonde beauty filmed herself “getting unready” at the end of the day. Alexi detailed: “Let’s get unready so I can show you exactly how much of a catfish I am.” The influencer began removing her makeup as she shared stories from her day and highlighted the importance of self-positivity. “You’re loved and you’re worthy exactly as you are right now,” she told her followers in the clip. Alexi’s acne-prone skin was clearly visible on camera as she carried out her evening skincare routine. However, the TikToker didn’t focus on any perceived flaws, sharing instead how exhausting her extensive night routine is. She explained: “This is honestly the worst part of the night, it just feels like such a chore.” The TikToker also raved about her foundation to her followers. “I’ve been wearing this makeup for 10 hours now and it is approved by me. Look how good it still looks,” Alexi said. TikTok users took to the comments section to share their thoughts on Alexi’s look. “You’re beautiful, with or without the makeup! As a woman, I always feel feisty with makeup,” wrote one viewer. Another follower said: “Not a catfish. Stop it you’re beautiful.” “I love you before and even more after. Normalize acne. It’s freaking normal people!!!” commented a third person. Another woman said: “I’m begging and pleading for a makeup tutorial!!! Finally someone relatable!!! You’re so beautiful.” Alexi joked that removing her makeup and carrying out her skincare routine is the “worst part of the night”aleximckinley/TikTok\n",

            "OVER 1 billion people expected to celebrate the annual Chinese New Year festival. Also known as Spring Festival and Lunar New Year, these who attend enjoy fireworks and pray for good fortune in the year ahead – and here are the key dates. GettyRabbits are set to be the main theme at this year’s celebrations, as 2023 is the year of the Rabbit[/caption] Chinese New Year 2023 key dates The Chinese New Year lasts for 16 days, starting from Chinese New Year’s Eve to the Lantern Festival. This is year it will fall on Sunday, January 22nd, 2023, and every year comes with an animal, this a year is the Rabbit. As a public holiday, Chinese people will get 7 days off from work from January 21st to January 27th in 2023. Each day of the festival has a name, including days for prayer, for visiting relatives, setting off firecrackers, and preparing for the Lantern Festival. Here are the key dates: January 21 – Chinese New Year’s Eve This is often viewed as the most important celebration as it includes the family reunion dinner, and staying up until midnight. January 22 – New Year’s Day New Year’s Day is spent visiting family, and giving presents. February 5 – Lantern Festival This day marks the end of the Chinese New Year when lanterns are lit and hung, and people watch dragon dances in the street. How do people celebrate Chinese New Year? Millions of people celebrate Chinese New Year across the world, bringing a period of colourful decorations and feasting. The event is usually celebrated with parades and performances, with people in traditional costumes and plenty of fireworks. In line with the introduction of the spring season, people plant harvests and eat lavish feasts. Noodle soup is the traditional meal of choice as the noodles are believed to bring luck. Communal hotpots are also a popular option for a feast as they are thought to represent the reunion of family members around the table. The Lunar calendar has 12 Chinese zodiac animal signs and as 2023 will be a year of the Rabbit, decorations related to rabbits will be commonly seen. People deep clean their homes before the New Year as it is bad luck to sweep your home on the day itself in case good luck for the year is swept out of the house. Money and presents are also given and received in red envelopes and packaging to ward off evil. As a public holiday, Chinese people get seven days off work for the celebrations. Businesses and schools shut down during the New Year period – like they do in the UK over the Christmas period – and many factories have a two-week shutdown. Beyond China, families in Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Myanmar, North Korea and South Korea also celebrate the event. It is widely believed that more fireworks are set off across the world for this festival than any other. How will Chinese New Year be celebrated in 2023? Many Chinatowns will be busy as huge public events have been are organized, including London’s famous Chinese New Year parade, for which the details are yet to be confirmed. Families will get together for the celebrations to share gifts, and cook a feast for the important family dinner. Manchester’s Chinatown will, for example, host a full day of family-friendly activities from 21st to 29th of January, including lion dancing, Chinese dancers, street food stalls and Chinese arts and crafts. Even though there has been a spike in Coronavirus cases in China, the government has not imposed stringent travel restriction measures for the 2023 Chinese New Year as it did two years ago, where travellers were required to take PCR tests and self-isolate for a specified period. This year, it seems that residents will be allowed to travel across provinces during the holiday. Chinese New Year celebrations will look a little different in each corner of the world, but they sure seem to be in full swing in their birthplace, China.\n",

Lenovo The screen floats above the keyboard. You can also spot the dual USB-C ports in this picture. Lenovo The back. The keyboard connects to the pogo pins for power and sticks on with magnets. Lenovo The screen. Those are some pretty slim bezels. I'm sure that's a good thing for a tablet you need to hold. Lenovo For a few years now, Lenovo has been a reliable builder of high-end Android tablets. Its latest is the \"Lenovo Tab Extreme,\" an extra-large tablet whose 14.5-inch display lands right in the normal laptop range. It also has a laptop-sized price: $1,199. The tablet is meant to compete directly with the iPad Pro, and there's even a floaty \"magic keyboard\" clone. The display is a 14.5-inch 3000×1876, 120 Hz OLED with an ambient color sensor. That's big, and the tablet without any accessories weighs 740 g (1.63 lbs). There's pen input via the included \" Lenovo Precision Pen 3 ,\" a magnetically attachable Bluetooth pen with 4,096 levels of pressure, tilt sensitivity, and all the usual detection. The big new addition is the new \"Lenovo Tab Extreme Keyboard,\" which attaches to the tablet via magnets and pogo pins, allowing it to be powered by the tablet battery. The whole thing cribs Apple's \"Magic Keyboard\" design, with the tablet floating above the keyboard. The hinge works a lot like a laptop, allowing you to tilt the screen to a comfortable position or just close the whole thing like a traditional laptop. The keyboard is full-size and has backlit keys and a tiny trackpad at the bottom. If you don't want to drag the full keyboard around, the tablet also has a lightweight kickstand that can magnetically attach to the back. The kickstand will support the tablet in landscape or portrait modes, and with DisplayPort in and out over USB-C, you can use the tablet as an extra monitor or power a second monitor with it. While the keyboard is self-supporting, it has a cutout on the back to make room for the kickstand so both accessories can be attached at the same time. When you rip the tablet off the keyboard, it's ready to go, with the kickstand already attached. Advertisement There's also a magnetic kickstand that can attach along with the keyboard case. They fit inside each other. Lenovo You can end up with a stack of acessories. This is the closed keyboard case, plus the kickstand, plus the pen. Scharon Harding The pen can magnetically attach to the side of the tablet like this. Scharon Harding And it will hang above the magic keyboard. Scharon Harding There's also this folio case. Lenovo There are two USB-C ports, one in the usual spot centered on the side of the tablet and another on that same side in the corner. Both can be used for charging, reverse charging, and audio out. One port, a Type-C 3.2 Gen 1, is for DisplayPort out , while the other 2.0 port is for DisplayPort in. The tablet can either be a monitor or power another monitor with Android. There's certainly plenty of room for two USB-C ports, saving you from having to use a dongle if you want to plug in a monitor and charge the tablet simultaneously. Its SoC is a MediaTek Dimensity 9000. This is rather rare in the Android space, but it's a Cortex X2 chip, putting it in the same generation as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 (a 2022 flagship chip). The tablet has 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 12300 mAh battery, and 68 W quick charging. For cameras, it has a front 13 MP sensor, a rear 13 MP main sensor, and a 5 MP wide-angle sensor. There's a fingerprint sensor on the power key, a microSD slot, and Wi-Fi 6E compatibility. Lenovo wants this to be a \"Media powerhouse,\" so the device has eight speakers. The tablet comes with Android 13, and Lenovo offers three years of major Android updates and four years of security updates. That's a big improvement for the company, which didn't do great at providing consistent Android updates during its ownership of Motorola. There's no release date.\n",

But after Derren Brown’s Showman, I can no longer say I still hold that view. © Mark DouetDerren moves into more emotional territory with his latest offering[/caption] © Mark DouetNot being called up doesn’t mean you’ll be free of his spell[/caption] His latest show, which has finally landed in the West End, touches on subjects we are all familiar with – love, loss, grief, and a need to belong. Many of us have seen his specials on TV, but seeing his impressive illusionist skills in the flesh is something else. He opens the show by whittling down the audience to a single member who is invited on stage – using a phone call. Then, when they are surrounded by a spotlight they suddenly slump and fall into a sleep – I dare reveal nothing more as I don’t want to have the ire of Derren following me around. What I can say is, this show feels substantially more personal than any of his performances through the screen. He carefully raises some of our most personal emotions but in a tender way rather than to see people make fools of themselves. If you think not being on stage will save you from his skills in trickery and mind changing – think again. His power reaches into the audience, and at one point he tells those to leave who don’t want to fall under his spell. You’ll enter as one of hundreds with no connection – and by the end, you’ll feel part of something larger and connected to everyone who has shared your experience.

            "The term 'neurodiversity' comes from autistic communities and means that all brains and 'bodyminds' work in diverse ways. (Shutterstock)The connection between language and meaning has been well established. The language we use is directly related to the way we view and treat others. Inclusive language is imperative to achieve equitable change, grounded in human rights and social justice. Many countries today have laws protecting against the use of any language that incites or wilfully promotes hatred against an identifiable group. Many municipalities, organizations and school boards have established inclusive language guides. Although the scope of these laws vary, what they have in common is recognizing the gravity of language. And yet, who decides on the right words? My research has considered this question with regards to disability in kindergarten to Grade 12 education. A community’s own expertise Preferences regarding disability-related language are established by the disability community. These preferences are distilled over time through an ebb and flow of factors including advocacy and allyship, grassroots activism, legal and legislative proceedings and empirical research. In Canada, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights of individuals by enshrining those rights, and certain limits on them, in the highest law of the land. The Charter protects against discrimination, including disability hate speech. Internationally, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), of which Canada is a primary signatory, aims to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities without discrimination and on an equal basis with others. Parties to the UNCPRD are required to promote and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights for people with disabilities, including full equality under the law. Terminology about any community must reflect their autonomy, preference and ideals. The disabled community has been subjected not only to paternalism but also eugenics. Policymakers across society have ignored their inherent expertise. Systemic ableism in schools In a recent study involving adults with disabilities reflecting on their experiences in kindergarten to Grade 12 education in the United States, researcher Carlyn O. Mueller found schools continue to lag behind in terms of: a lack of disability representation in K-12 curriculum; a lack of disability community in K-12 schools; a lack of school staff with disabilities. Schools need to factor disabled students into mainstream planning so families like Dean Dompierre, left, and his son, Eric Dompierre, pictured here at a 2012 state Senate committee hearing, in Lansing, Mich., don’t have to fight for particular accommodations. (AP Photo/Al Goldis) These findings remain consistent today with what I have observed about systemic ableism in Canadian schools and in current research in the field of inclusive education and disability studies. Kindergarten to Grade 12 schooling is often stigmatizing for students with disabilities. Ableist slurs continue, and segregationist practices abound while disability representation in staff, programming and curriculum remains limited at best. A community The disability community is the largest diversity-equity group globally. It’s also one that many of us will join throughout our lifetime. It is important to remember disability is not synonymous with notions of lacking, charity or pity. Read more: Think disability is a tragedy? We pity you Nor do disabled people need to be fixed through interventions. Rather, disability is part of the human experience. Moving away from derogatory terms, such as “special” and “exceptional” is important. This promotes positive representation for people within the disability community, and respects their human rights. Human rights perspectives stress that our society recognizes and names disability as the consequence of a person interacting with an environment that does not accommodate their differences. This lack of accommodation impedes participation in society. Inequality is due to the inability of society to eliminate barriers challenging persons with disabilities. Children learning sign language at school could be one example of how schools could be part of a societal commitment to eliminate barriers affecting Deaf people. Here, a child learns sign language in a school classroom in Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 2016. (AP Photo/Amel Emric) Some terminology The following is some terminology that schools and communities can use to promote inclusivity: Neurodiversity and neurodivergence: Neurodiversity, originating in the autism community, reflects the notion that all “bodyminds” work in diverse ways. As noted by the Critical Disability Studies Collective at University of Minnesota, the terms neurodiversity and neurodivergence “come from autistic communities, who have welcomed folks with other marginalized brain/bodyminds to use them, including but not limited to people with cognitive, brain injury, epilepsy, learning and mental health disabilities.” Ableism advances the belief that “typical” abilities are normal and superior. Ableism assumes disabled people need to be fixed and an ableist attitude defines people as lesser while including harmful stereotypes about disabilities. Ableism often leads to discriminatory beliefs, attitudes and actions often resulting in segregationist and exclusionary measures. The medical model of disability says people are disabled by their impairments or differences. Under the medical model, impairment is equated with being broken and in need of a fix. Even when the impairment or difference does not cause pain or illness, the individual is considered lesser. The medical model lens can lead to stigma and may be considered a prelude to ableism. The social model of disability: Created by disabled people, the social model argues humans naturally come in a variety of bodyminds, which are changed and shaped by our environment. Disability is part of the human experience. The social model argues that nothing is wrong with the disabled bodymind but that inaccessible structures, systems and attitudes of society are the issue that need fixing. The social model sets the foundation for equitable approaches for inclusion. Wheelchair user/rider: Those who use a wheelchair. Educators, scholars, and allies must demand disability-appropriate terminology and representation in all K-12 schools.

            "The popularity of video-based social media means that more people are producing video content than at any other time in recorded human history. So, naturally, companies providing royalty-free video clips for use in broadcast video is also becoming very popular. “Royalty free” means you don’t have to pay a royalty every time you use a clip in a production, which is the case for most commercial stock footage. In this increasingly litigious world, it also provides welcome peace of mind to know that if you intend to monetize or broadcast your videos, that the footage you include has been pre-cleared for any use you might want to put it to. This review takes a look at the Videvo and the yearly plans it offers on its stock video footage. This is a sponsored article and was made possible by Videvo. The actual contents and opinions are the sole views of the author who maintains editorial independence even when a post is sponsored. Videvo is a stock-footage video-clip service that provides high-quality clips, both free and paid, and in Full HD and 4K, for royalty-free use in video productions. A high proportion of the clips are free, but a simple subscription is required to access the premium clips. The quality of the clips is very high, and the interface, through which you access the clips, is very well-designed and clean. Most free clips require some form of attribution, which means you have to give credit to Videvo or the creator, depending on the license for that clip. If you upgrade to a paid account, you won’t need to worry about paying a royalty or adding attribution and can use them as many times a you want, in many cases commercially. The library has expanded over the years since it was founded, and it now contains over 60,000 stock footage clips, 1200 motion graphics templates, and 200,000 music and sound effects, all under a variety of licenses (including the Videvo Attribution License, Creative Commons 3.0, and royalty free). For whatever sort of clip you need, there’s literally something for everyone. It’s a comprehensive library with much to recommend, as the library does not stop at stock video and footage. It’s a one-stop shop for multimedia, as the library includes free music and After Effects and Premiere Pro templates. It even includes sound effects! Most people who make video for broadcast or streaming need more content than they can personally generate – it’s a fact of life. For a gloss of professionalism, nothing cuts the mustard like a well-chosen piece of pro stock footage. For less professional applications, even if you only make films for your own enjoyment, stock footage can add spice to your creative work and add production value to the most meager productions. What you need is a stock video library with a range of different subjects that has what are called “usable” clips, things you can cut in without too much trouble that match a range of styles. In pro filmmaking, stock footage saves time and, most importantly, money. Do you think those establishing shots of Paris were shot specially for the movie? Nope. Unless the budget is huge, they just shot the interiors in a studio in Burbank and paid a bundle for a quality stock shot of a Parisian street as the establishing shot. Videvo is unique in the sense that it has both free and premium clips. As a basic account holder, you can peruse and download the free clips and use them any way you see fit, as long as you obey the terms of use and attribute the credit to the creator when you use them. This free tier of the service will get you a long way before you have to pay them anything. But they also have a higher tier of clips, those which are available only to subscribers, and these tend to be the higher-quality clips and, presumably, the clips that are not royalty free, as they cost a lot to make. What I like about Videvo is that the clips are high quality, and it’s very easy to navigate and choose the clips you want using the online library browser. It’s very clear what the clip contains and what resolutions it’s available in. Obviously, the vast majority of the clips are HD 1920 x 1080, but as the library has expanded, a large range of clips are now available in 4K, which is a great resource as we make the transition to the higher resolution. It’s possible that some of the bigger premium stock sites have many more clips. But as downsides go, that’s not a terrible one, as it will take you a LONG time to run out of clips on Videvo, and the site is adding new clips and creators all the time. It will only get better. Videvo is on the base level available for free to anyone without signing up. If, however, you want access to the premium videos on the site, an upgrade to Videvo Plus is just $14.99 per month, but you can get 15% off with the code MTE 15 to pay just $12.74. For that, you get royalty-free licensing for use of the clips in your videos, no adverts, and the ability to cancel at any time. There is also an upper level called Videvo Pro for $24.99 per month, that you can get for $21.24 fter applying the same code: MTE 15 . You get all of the above plus access to more than 100,000 premium audio clips for that extra production gloss. Phil South has been writing about tech subjects for over 30 years.

            "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. said Thursday it has worked with Turkey to impose sanctions on four people and two firms that it says provided financial support to the Islamic State group. The announcement signaled counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries at a time of tensions over efforts to fight Islamic State. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has threatened an offensive into Syria against Kurdish militants he has blamed for a deadly Nov. 13 bombing in Istanbul. That has alarmed U.S. officials. Kurdish groups have been allied with the U.S. in the fight against Islamic State group and have warned that a Turkish escalation would threaten anti-IS efforts. In its announcement Thursday, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said it was imposing sanctions on an Iraqi national living in Turkey, Abd Al Hamid Salim Ibrahim Ismail Brukan al-Khatuni, his sons and the Turkish money service firm where they all worked. They are accused of facilitating financial transfers to and from Iraq and Syria for the benefit of the Islamic State. Another individual, Lu’ay Jasim Hammadi al-Juburi, an Islamic State financial administration official also living in Turkey, was accused of using the firm Sham Express, a company founded in 2020 by Brukan al-Khatuni, to transfer funds to ISIS. Thursday’s sanctions actions freeze and block any potential transactions with U.S. entities and prevents Americans from doing business with them. The State Department noted that Turkey is concurrently freezing the assets of those targeted by the U.S. sanctions. Brian Nelson, Treasury’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said Thursday’s actions reaffirm “Treasury’s commitment to degrade ISIS’s ability to operate globally.” The actions come after two November rounds of sanctions were imposed on people and firms in Africa who it says have provided financial or material support to Islamic State. The Islamic State group is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. In November, Defense Department officials warned that they were “deeply concerned” about escalating IS activities in Iraq, Syria and Turkey. “This escalation threatens the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS’s years-long progress to degrade and defeat ISIS,” said Pentagon Press Secretary Brig Gen Patrick Ryder.

            "PRESIDENT Musalli Al-Muammar was head of the Saudi Pro League before taking over Al-Nassr. The Saudi Arabian team has become Ronaldo’s new employer. GettyRonaldo shakes hands with the President of Al Nassr FC. Musalli Al-Muammar[/caption] Who is Al-Nassr president Musalli Al-Muammar? Musalli Al-Muammar is the president of the club and was elected by Al Nassr board members in 2021. Before that, Al-Muammar was president of the Saudi Pro League for nearly two years. Al-Nassr has also close ties with the royal family of the country. Prince Khalid bin Fahd bin Abdulaziz is reportedly the main man behind Al-Nassr’s major funding in football over the last few years. Al-Muammar was also favoured by the Prince to take over as the president of the football club. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in finance from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran. After that, he did his master’s degree in marketing communications at Manchester Metropolitan University. Al-Muammar then worked as a sports columnist for Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper from 2007 to 2017. What is Al-Nassr president Musalli Al-Muammar’s net worth? Little is known about Al-Muammar’s net worth and he has managed to not reveal any information on his investments. One thing he did reveal was that when took the club over in 2021, Al-Nassr was in debt of £50 million. With the help of Al-Muammar and Saudi Arabia’s royals, the team has been able to rise as one of the top teams in Asia. This has given them the ability to sign top players from European teams, including their newest one, Cristiano Ronaldo. Why did Cristiano Ronaldo sign for Al-Nassr? Ronaldo stated that he received a lot of offers from different clubs from Brazil, Portugal and the United States. But, he said that he gave his word to Al-Nassr, and after playing for the top clubs in Europe, now it was time for a new challenge – Asia. Ahead of his unveiling, the 37-year-old was greeted by a capacity crowd of 25,000 at a raucous Mrsool Park in Riyad, along with a spectacular light show. The Twitter account of Al-Nassr put a video of the ceremony, with the caption, “The GOAT (Greatest of all time) has arrived”. Before walking onto the pitch to greet his new fans, Ronaldo said in a press conference: ” I feel so proud to make this big decision in my life.” Al Nassr is coached by Rudi Garcia, who previously managed Lille, Roma, Marseille and Lyon. They are top of the league this season after 11 games. The team must win the league this season to qualify for the 2023-24 Asian Champions League.\n",

This week (for the upcoming Billboard 200 albums chart dated Jan. 14): SZA’s SOS kicks off 2023 as the album still to beat, while sets from ATEEZ and Fuerza Regida freshen up the chart. Related SZA's 'SOS' Tops Billboard 200 for Third Week in a Row 01/05/2023 SZA, SOS (Top Dawg Entertainment/RCA): After five years, SZA’s second album had a blockbuster No. 1 debut in December, with 318,000 equivalent album units. The album, which built on SZA’s accelerating momentum over that layover period (including viral solo hits and appearances on radio smashes from Kendrick Lamar and Doja Cat), is still putting up huge numbers in early 2023, just spending its third week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with over 100,000 units. SOS seems likely to spend winter 2023 how Bad Bunny’s Un Verano Sin Ti spent last summer and Taylor Swift’s Midnights spent last autumn – as the chart’s default No. 1 for any week where there isn’t a major new release to depose it. When might that first major new release come? Star rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again announced this week that his I Rest My Case album would come out Jan. 6 as the first release from his new Motown home – though releasing seven full-length projects in 2022 seems to have slowed his chart momentum. Still, 2022’s first two major releases (Gunna’s DS4ever and The Weeknd’s Dawn FM, both released Jan. 7) were both announced mere days before release, so the first big bow of 2023 may well be an album we don’t know about yet. ATEEZ, Spin Off: From the Witness (KQ Entertainment/RCA): Eight-member K-pop boy band ATEEZ scored a major chart breakthrough last summer with The World EP.1: Movement, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. New set Spin Off: From the Witness may follow Movement to the chart’s top tier – boosted, of course, by at least six different collectible CD variants (including one signed by the group), each containing a set of standard branded paper goods and randomly chosen items (like photocards and posters). Fuerza Regida, Sigan Hablando (Rancho Humilde/Street Mob): Regional Mexican quintet Fuerza Regida landed its first Billboard Hot 100 hit this week with the TikTok-boosted Grupo Frontera collab “Bebe Dame,” which debuts at No. 91. That song is found on the quintet’s latest album, Sigan Hablando (released Dec. 28), which should ride the “Bebe” bump to the group’s first entry on the Billboard 200 – though the band has already reached the Top Latin Albums chart five times and spent 18 weeks atop the Regional Mexican Albums chart in 2022 with Del Barrio Hasta Aqui.\n",

            "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during a news conference as a member of his RCMP security detail stands by on Bowen Island, B.C., in July 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl DyckNear the end of 2022, it was reported that the RCMP faces a severe shortage of police officers to protect federal ministers, diplomats and other government officials. This staff shortage is occurring at a time when threats against Canadian politicians appear to be at an all-time high. During testimony at last fall’s Emergencies Act inquiry, it was revealed that Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland received an emailed death threat against her from a supporter of the so-called freedom convoy that descended upon Ottawa in February 2022. The inquiry also learned that a former member of Justin Trudeau’s RCMP protection team may have leaked the prime minister’s schedule in advance to protest organizers. These threats and vulnerabilities pose a serious risk to Canada’s national security. It will require political will, resources and policy changes to tackle the issue. Threats increasing Threats against public officials of all political stripes are dramatically on the rise amid the current political climate. According to data from the United States Capitol Police, threats against members of Congress increased by 107 per cent from 2020 to 2021. An example of this trend was the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband inside their San Francisco residence in October 2022. Canadian politicians have also been victims of similar attacks, including when an armed, serving member of the Canadian military rammed his truck through the gates of Trudeau’s Ottawa residence in July 2020. An RCMP officer works with a police dog as they move through the contents of a pickup truck on the grounds of Rideau Hall in Ottawa in July 2020 after a man threatened Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld Provincial public officials aren’t immune to the recent dramatic increase in threats, harassment and intimidation. In Québec, sentences ranging from probation to prison time have been handed out to those who have engaged in such criminal behaviour. What motivates those who threaten and wish to inflict harm on political figures varies across a wide spectrum. In the case of the Trudeau attack, the perpetrator had posted QAnon theories on social media, suggesting right-wing extremist views.

Several men have pleaded guilty or been convicted of plotting to kidnap the Democrat. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) Recent research on politicians in the United Kingdom revealed that women receive significantly more threats and acts of intimidation from members of the public than their male counterparts. This would suggest the perpetrators likely hold sexist or misogynistic viewpoints. Other research suggests the vast majority of people wanting to target elected officials suffer from mental illness and will often exhibit warning behaviours in advance of their intention to harm. Public officials are vulnerable So what does the lack of protection officers within the RCMP mean for Canada’s national security? Firstly, leaving federal cabinet ministers, diplomats, high-ranking government officials and Supreme Court justices unprotected leaves them vulnerable to physical attacks and possible assassinations. In the event of such incidents, the confidence of Canadians in their government to protect them from domestic and foreign threats would be severely eroded. It would also signal that the government as a whole is weak and at risk of being attacked for any public grievance. Secondly, foreign adversaries could benefit from opportunities that arise from the disruption and uncertainties that inevitably occur in the aftermath of such attacks. This is how national security systems can be exploited for political and economic advantages. It has been widely reported that China has been targeting Canadian elected officials and trying to influence our democratic institutions. The physical presence of protection officers around our officials could also act as a deterrent against efforts to gain access to public officials, intelligence and highly confidential state secrets. Read more: 5 ways for Canada to tackle Chinese interference after the Trudeau-Xi showdown The easiest solution to the protection gap would be for parliamentarians to give the RCMP the necessary support and financial resources, something the federal cabinet is planning to study in the coming months. Private contractors a solution? But throwing money at a structural problem will not solve the issues in the short term. RCMP attrition is outpacing recruitment and it takes time to train new protection officers. A possible solution in both the short and long term is outsourcing protection for some public officials, like judges and high-ranking public servants, to the private sector. Andrea Horwath, then the leader of the NDP, is reflected in the sunglasses of her Ontario Provincial Police security detail during a campaign event in June 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette Many top CEOs and high net-worth individuals now have protection officers who are often former police and military members. As such, they could easily pass government security background checks and already possess many of the necessary skills to do the job. Private security organizations like AFIMAC provide protection specialists to organizations. AFIMAC, in fact, has already supported the RCMP during major events when additional resources are required or when security risks are heightened. The use of private sector contractors would also be cheaper over the long term given the pensions and benefits required to compensate RCMP officers. Whatever the federal cabinet decides, it’s clear the status quo is untenable for Canada’s national security. The protection of public figures is an increasingly essential requirement within our polarized political environment.

The Dutchman has guided the Red Devils to fourth in the Premier League table and six wins on the spin in all competitions. Erik ten Hag has a better record after 25 games than any of the last ten Manchester United managers to have reached that mark GettyTen Hag has enjoyed an impressive start to life as United manager[/caption] His overall tally in his first 25 competitive games as boss stands at 18 wins. That includes superb victories over Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham earlier in the season. It’s a record that cannot be matched by any of the last 10 United bosses to have taken charge of at least 25 games. Ten Hag has overseen 11 wins in the Premier League, as well as guiding his side to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and into the Europa League round of 32 play-off. On the other hand Sir Alex Ferguson, the greatest manager in United’s history, won just 12 out of his first 25 games. There’s still a long way to go to match Fergie’s 13 Premier League title triumphs, so Ten Hag won’t be getting carried away just yet. But his record is miles better than last season’s interim gaffer, Ralf Rangnick, who won a lowly ten out of his first 25 games in charge. Ten Hag’s record is also better than that of Jose Mourinho and David Moyes, who both had 14 wins after their first 25 games. FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS – BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS The closest gaffer to Ten Hag’s impressive record is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The former United striker was initially hired as caretaker manager when Mourinho was sacked. But he landed the job on a permanent basis after an impressive start, and after his first 25 games in charge he had 16 wins to his name. It’s still nothing on Ten Hag though, who will be looking to make it 19 wins from 26 games in the FA Cup this weekend.

In her post, Liv said: “We as females have grown up in a world where any single bump, stomach roll, bloat, any imperfection is to be hidden. “We’ve designed tights that hide any sign of storing body fat in that area, leggings that compress, dresses that are tight only in the areas that we want to show off. “So it’s absolutely no wonder that it’s something girls, from such a young age, can be self-conscious of, but it’s something they shouldn’t be.” Everyone has a bit of belly, she said, and there is nothing wrong with that. It’s normal so just love your tummy no matter what.

            "MEXICAN cartel gunmen have invaded an airport and opened fire at army planes in terrifying scenes. Dramatic video shows cartel fighters wielding weapons storming Culiacan International Airport in the western Mexican province of Sinaloa. Cartel gunmen have launched an attack on an international airport in Mexico Cartel gunmen fired inside a commercial aircraft as terrified passengers hid APThe violence is in response to the arrest of El Chapo’s son Ovidio[/caption] Drug cartel gunmen from the fearsome Sinaloa cartel have launched the violent raid in revenge for the capture of El Chapo‘s son Ovidio. The cartel’s armed wing has also set up roadblocks along the highways of Sinaloa to try and recapture the son of the notorious drug kingpin, who was seized earlier on Thursday. Horror scenes show gunmen opening fire inside a commercial aircraft while it taxis along the runway at Culiacan, as terrified passengers desperately hide behind their seats. A screaming baby can be heard in the background amid the gunfire. Further footage shared on social media shows a convoy of cartel “sicarios” rushing to confront the Mexican Army following Ovidio’s arrest. Another clip shows a Mexican military aircraft landing at the airport amid heavy gunfire. The Mexican airline Aeromexico has said that a plane meant to fly from Culiacan to Mexico City was hit by gunfire and has been cancelled for security reasons. No information has yet been released on any possible casualties in the raid on the airport. However, one Sinaloa official says that seven security personnel have been injured in clashes, and says 18 blockades remain in place across the state. The airline said the plane’s fuselage had been hit by gunfire on Thursday morning, but no passengers or workers had been harmed. Culiacan International was closed early on Thursday and will remain closed all day. Today’s attack on the international airport came after the Mexican Army tried to bring in equipment through the terminal in an attempt to quash the violent rebellion. Organised crime have seized various parts of the city of Culiacan, a stronghold of the Sinaloa cartel, carjacking city residents and torching vehicles in an apparent response to the arrest. Reports claim armed groups in Sinaloa have stormed hospitals and health centres, “kidnapping” doctors and nurses and forcing them to treat cartel fighters wounded in fighting with federal authorities. Two ambulances have reportedly been stolen with paramedics inside and doctors seized from several hospitals in the Sinaloan town of Navolato. We ask the citizens of Culiacan not to leave home due to the blockades that have occurred in different parts of the city Juan de Dios GamezMayor, Culiacan Mexico City Airport has reported a number of delays and cancellations to flights due to the ongoing violence in Culiacan. Widespread looting has also been reported in Culiacan, although it isn’t yet known if this is the work of cartel fighters or ordinary citizens. Violence has spread to other airfields in Sinaloa, with passengers reporting being trapped underfire at Mazatlan Airport, some 130 miles southeast of Culiacan Airport. The son of the jailed drug lord Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman has allegedly helped to run the infamous Sinaloa Cartel since the extradition of his father to the United States in 2017. He has also been accused by the US State Department – along with his brother Joaquin – of currently overseeing some 11 meth labs in Sinaloa state, producing up to 2,200kg of the drug per month. Authorities believe he is also behind the murders of informants, a rival drug trafficker, and a popular Mexican singer who refused to sing at his wedding. Local and state authorities have urged the public to stay indoors and said federal forces would tomorrow announce the results of a vast pre-dawn military operation. Sinaloan state security chief Cristbal Castaeda issued a warning to citizens on Twitter and said the state was responding and would give a reponse when they could. “We ask the citizens of Culiacan not to leave home due to the blockades that have occurred in different parts of the city,” Culiacan Mayor Juan de Dios Gamez wrote on Twitter. All school classes in the city have been suspended so as to keep the population safe, according to a statement from the Secretary of Education. ReutersViolence has broken out in Mexico with cartel gunmen launching all-out war[/caption] EPAViolence has paralysed the Mexican city[/caption] ReutersCartel fighters have torched vehicles and set up roadblocks[/caption] AFPThe city – seen as the centre of the Sinaloa Cartel – is on lockdown[/caption] Ovidio was seized as part of a massive operation on Wednesday night in the town of Jesus Maria on the outskirts of Culiacan, according to sources linked to the Sinaloa Cartel. According to Radio Formula, Ovidio is being held at CDMX Military Camp 1, before being transferred either to a facility of the Attorney General’s Office or directly to a federal prison. The country’s Defence Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval has confirmed that he has already been flown secretly to Mexico City to avoid a repeat of 2019. Dramatic footage purportedly from Wednesday night’s raid shows a Mexican helicopter firing round after round from a 50-caliber machine gun at Sinaloa Cartel fighters. The arrest of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 32, would represent a major coup for the Mexican government in the war on drugs, ahead of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s meeting with his US counterpart Joe Biden next week at a summit for North American leaders. President Obrador’s left-wing government had previously been accused of going soft on the cartels, after he said that the violent tactics of his predecessors in response to the cartels had failed and only led to more bloodshed. Instead, he called for a strategy of “hugs not bullets”. It comes after Ovidio Guzman was briefly captured in 2019 before security forces were forced to free him after the cartel launched an all-out war in response on the streets of Culiacan. The forced release of Ovidio after the authorities were out-gunned by the cartels, was an embarrassing setback for the Mexican government. His reported arrest in a daring raid will help Mexican law enforcement save face following 2019’s humiliation, according to experts. Tomas Guevara, a security expert at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, told Reuters: “The detention of Ovidio is finally the culmination of something that was planned three years ago.” El Chapo is currently serving life in prison in the US for trafficking hundreds of tons of drugs into the United States over a 25-year period. The 65-year-old was convicted in 2019 of trafficking worth billions of dollars, as well as conspiring to murder his enemies. He is being held at the United State’s most secure federal prison, supermax ADX Florence in Colorado. But his cartel remains one of the most powerful in Mexico, and one of the largest drug trafficking organisations in the world. The United States previously offered a $5m reward for information leading to Ovidio’s arrest or conviction.\n",

            "The man accused of murdering Migos rapper Takeoff was released from a Houston jail late Wednesday (Jan. 4) after posting a $1 million bond, court records show. According to filings in Harris County court and from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office obtained by Billboard, Patrick Xavier Clark posted bond on Wednesday and was released at 8:47 p.m. local time. He’s due back in court for a hearing on March 9. Bond had initially been set at $2 million, but Clark’s lawyers argued that that figure was excessive and potentially unconstitutional — essentially a backdoor to simply denying bond altogether. After they demanded the figure be lowered to $100,000, the judge agreed to reduce it to $1 million on Dec. 14. Related Quavo Pays Tribute to Takeoff on Emotional Single ‘Without You’ 01/05/2023 Court records show Clark will still be under 24/7 house arrest, cannot have any contact with anyone involved, and will be required to wear a GPS monitor that can immediately notify prosecutors and defense attorneys of any violations. He must also submit to drug testing and cannot drink alcohol, as court records indicate that “alcohol was a factor in the offense.” A representative for the late star did not immediately return a request for comment on Clark’s release. Clark’s lawyer also did not respond to a request for comment. Takeoff (born Kirshnik Khari Ball), 28, was shot and killed Nov. 1 during a private party he attended at 810 Billiards & Bowling in downtown Houston with his uncle and bandmate, Quavo. The musician was killed by “penetrating gunshot wounds of head and torso into arm,” according to a report from the Harris County coroner’s office. Clark, 33, was arrested on the east side of Houston on Nov. 1 and charged with murder; another man, 22-year-old Cameron Joshua, was arrested and charged with the unlawful carrying of a weapon.\n",

            "Enlarge (credit: Cadillac) The world of Formula 1 got a shock on Thursday morning when General Motors announced it has plans to enter the championship. GM wants to go F1 racing with its Cadillac brand, partnering with a new Andretti Global team, assuming the sport's organizing body accepts the entry. F1 has been fixed at 10 teams since Haas joined the sport in 2016. Since then, the series has introduced a new budget cap that has reined in some of the crazier budgets and made the prospect of operating an F1 team much less of a financial black hole. The exact amount of the cost cap is adjusted depending on how many races are planned for a year—for 2023, that should be $138.6 million—and even finishing in 10th place earns a team enough money to cover about 70 percent of those costs. As a result, the sport is now a much more attractive proposition for new entrants than it was the last time we gained new teams in 2010, none of which survived. But there's a snag: You can't just turn up at the start of a season with a couple of cars and expect to go racing. The sport's organizing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), requires that any new team \"buy in\" to the franchise with a $200 million \"non-dilution fee\" meant to ensure a new competitor doesn't cost the existing 10 teams any of their income.Read 13 remaining paragraphs | Comments\n",

            "Damar Hamlin is still in critical condition but appears to be \"neurologically intact,\" the Buffalo Bills said in a statement Thursday, three days after the 24-year-old player collapsed during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Citing physicians at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, the team said the player has \"shown remarkable improvement over the past 24 hours.\"The Bills had said Wednesday the safety was in intensive care in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest.Hamlin's uncle, Dorrian Glenn, spoke to reporters outside the University of Cincinnati Medical Center on Tuesday night and said his nephew's heart stopped twice, once on the field and again at the hospital, CBS Chicago's Charlie De Mar reported. Glenn also said Hamlin has lung damage and can't breathe on his own. The player had been receiving 100% oxygen from a ventilator but that is down to only 50%, he said.\"His lungs continue to heal and he is making steady progress,\" the Bills said Thursday.What happened in the Monday Night Football game?With 5:58 to go in the game's first quarter, Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins, who was running the ball, hit Hamlin, a 24-year-old safety, in the chest with his helmet during a play. Hamlin dragged Higgins down to the ground. Hamlin stood up right after — but a few seconds later, collapsed.Medical personnel attended to Hamlin for 19 minutes on the field, The Associated Press reported, and Hamlin received both CPR and required an automated external defibrillator. CBS Sports reported he was placed on a stretcher, then put in an ambulance, where he was given oxygen, to be taken to the hospital.The remainder of the game between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals was postponed.The Bills said early Tuesday that Hamlin had suffered cardiac arrest and his heartbeat was restored on the field, and he was transferred to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for further testing and treatment. He was sedated and listed in critical condition, the team said.  Damar Hamlin spent last night in the intensive care unit and remains there today in critical condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.We are grateful and thankful for the outpouring of support we have received thus far.— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) January 3, 2023 In an update Wednesday, the team tweeted that Hamlin \"remains in the ICU in critical condition with signs of improvement noted yesterday and overnight. He is expected to remain under intensive care as his health care team continues to monitor and treat him.\"Fans rallied outside the hospital following Hamlin's injury, and donated millions of dollars to Hamlin's effort to buy Christmas toys for children from his hometown of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, outside Pittsburgh. What is \"commotio cordis\"?While it's not yet clear exactly what Hamlin experienced, CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus said Hamlin may have suffered what's known as commotio cordis, which is heart arrhythmia that occurs when someone takes a direct hit to their chest.Agus said approximately 30 cases of commotio cordis occur in the U.S. every year, including among Little League players who get hit in the chest with a ball.   Describing the condition as \"a confusion of the heart,\" where the heart muscle pumps erratically, Agus said the energy of the blow interferes with the electrical signals in the heart, creating a new beat known as ventricular fibrillation — a fast, erratic heartbeat that does not pump blood into the brain. When that happens, Agus said the heart needs to be shocked back into regular rhythm.\"That's why there are defibrillators on the sidelines of games, is to be able to use them to shock the best heart back into a regular rhythm,\" he said.Agus said every minute blood flow is stopped to the brain increases the potential of severe consequences — including death.\"Every minute you wait is basically 10% increase likelihood of death — so the quicker you do it, the better,\" he said.There is a question of whether Hamlin suffered any injury to his brain from his heart stopping. The faster they were able to get his heart started, Agus said, the more likely it is he will recover quickly.\"People who don't even know us are showing love and support and we're so thankful for that,\" Glenn, the player's uncle, said. \"I know those prayers are helping because he's definitely recovering. ... God got a mission for him and that's why he's still here.\"\n",

            "The Atiku-Okowa presidential campaign organization on Thursday blasted the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, over President Muhammadu Buhari’s absence at the party’s campaign rallies. Since the president graced the APC campaign flag-off in Jos, Plateau State, in October last year he has been conspicuously absent at the party’s rallies in many states of the federation. The presidency late last year issued a statement and assured APC members of President Buhari’s commitment to the party’s success in the February 25 election. The campaign organization was reacting to a statement credited to the APC candidate about his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rival, Atiku Abubakar. Tinubu had during one of the party’s rallies in the North said the former Vice President lacked the integrity to rule Nigeria. READ ALSO: APC campaign berates ‘confused’ Atiku’s team for endless attack on Tinubu In a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, the organization said Buhari’s absence from APC presidential campaign rallies was an indication that he lacked confidence in the party candidate’s ability to win next month’s election. The organization also challenged the former Lagos State governor to clear himself on the allegations hanging on his neck. The statement read: “Is it not an absurdity that a presidential candidate that is beleaguered by several allegations bordering on corruption, perjury, [and] identity theft could muster the courage to address any gathering whatsoever on the issue of Integrity? “The Atiku/Okowa campaign says the continuous absence of President Buhari at the APC presidential campaigns showcases a concern by Mr. President that Tinubu will lose a free, fair and credible poll at the February 25 presidential election.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

            "US car giant General Motors have announced ambitious plans to join Formula One in 2026. The move will see GM use their Cadillac brand to form a partnership with US race team Andretti Autosport, owned by Michael Andretti the son of former F1 racer, Mario Andretti. Andretti and GM say the Andretti Cadillac team would be based in the US with a support facility in the UK as they start a lengthy application process between F1 and the governing body, the FIA. Michael Andretti said: \"We are well suited to be a new team for Formula One and can bring value to the series and our partners, and excitement for the fans. \"I'm proud to have GM and Cadillac alongside us as we pursue this goal. GM and Andretti share a legacy born out of the love of racing. \"We now have the opportunity to combine our motorsport passions and dedication to innovation to build a true American F1 bid.\" The Andretti Cadillac bid is not the only interested party in joining the sport, which has seen rapid growth across the world since the pandemic , particularly in the US. F1's owners, Liberty Media have been instrumental in adding extra races and this season will see the addition of a third race in the States with the Las Vegas GP joining Austin and Miami on the calendar. However, it is not a foregone conclusion that the Andretti Cadillac bid will be automatically accepted by F1, the FIA or the current teams. An F1 statement said: \"There is great interest in the F1 project at this time with a number of conversations continuing that are not as visible as others. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST NEW CUSTOMER SIGN UP DEALS \"We all want to ensure the championship remains credible and stable and any new entrant request will be assessed on criteria to meet those objectives by all the relevant stakeholders. \"Any new entrant request requires the agreement of both F1 and the FIA.\"\n",

            "Over the holiday period, a pedal-powered Christmas tree became the symbol of Ukraine’s defiant resistance against Russia’s relentless bombing campaign which Vladimir Putin hoped would spoil everyone’s Yuletide. Usually the Orthodox church would celebrate Christmas on January 7, but a decision was made by the Ukraine church to give its parishes the option to mark the festival on December 25, as a way of breaking from the Russian Orthodox church, which has been a vocal supporter of Putin’s war from the beginning. Russia has been trying, with some success, to target Ukraine’s power grid, putting many basic services from healthcare to sanitation at risk. But while this has resulted in blackouts across the country at the coldest time of the year, on the whole the country still appears as defiant as ever. Putin, meanwhile, has called a ceasefire to allow Russians to celebrate Orthodox Christmas on January 7. And, as Stefan Wolff – an expert in international security from the University of Birmingham and regular contributor to our coverage of the conflict – writes, there are plenty of reasons for Ukraine to be cautiously optimistic. Much of the territory gained by Russia in the first months of the war has been recaptured in Ukraine’s autumn counteroffensive. The visit by Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to Washington in December yielded a pledge of an additional US$1.85 billion (£1.5 billion) in security assistance – including, significantly, American Patriot air defence systems, which will give Kyiv the capability to strike targets insides Russia if it chooses. Meanwhile a missile strike against Russian troop concentration area in Makiivka, close to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on New Year’s Day is reported to have dealt another severe blow to Russian military morale. But Wolff also warns that Russia is far from a spent force and, with the prospect of further mobilisation in coming months, there is – sadly – no end in sight for this tragic and illegal conflict. Read more: Ukraine war: despite Russian setbacks, an end to the conflict is not yet in sight This is our weekly recap of expert analysis of the Ukraine conflict. The Conversation, a not-for-profit newsgroup, works with a wide range of academics across its global network to produce evidence-based analysis. Get these recaps in your inbox every Thursday. Subscribe here. Ever closer to Nato Looking back to this time last year, when the Russian troop build-up near the Ukraine border was fuelling fears that an invasion might be imminent (despite Putin’s repeated assertions to the contrary), one of the Russian president’s repeated claims was that a right-wing (even neo-Nazi) cabal which had seized power undemocratically was steering the country towards Nato membership. This, Putin insisted, was in breach of an agreement that the western alliance would not expand into what Moscow considered to be its traditional sphere of influence. The “special military operation” was partly launched to prevent that. Power struggle: Russia has always feared Nato’s eastwards expansion. Viacheslav Lopatin via Shutterstock If that was indeed a Kremlin war aim, it has misfired dramatically. Kristin M. Bakke, a professor of international relations at University College London, and a team of academics from the US and UK have been taking opinion surveys in Ukraine for some years and have monitored people’s views towards the west in general and Nato in particular. Between 2019 and October 2022, Bakke writes, there has been a massive swing in the number of people in Ukraine who identify with the west, while support for joining Nato has risen from 44% to 77% – the highest level ever recorded. And, while in 2019 the majority of people favoured Ukrainian neutrality, this situation has been reversed by eight months of conflict. These trends are most strongly reflected in the views of respondents between the ages of 18 and 30, more than 70% of whom disagreed with the statement that it would be “best for our country’s security to be neutral and stay out of military alliances”. Read more: Putin's plan to stop Ukraine turning to the west has failed -- our survey shows support for Nato is at an all-time high Hearts and minds Meanwhile, what appears to be a deliberate attempt by Russia to target Ukrainian schools will also do nothing to win the hearts and minds of the country’s young people. As Katja Kolcio an expert in education at Wesleyan University in the US writes, more than 2,500 schools have been damaged by artillery during the war. Kolcio, who has been conducting research in Ukraine since the Russian incursions in 2014, believes this is of a piece with what she sees as a deliberate campaign to weaponise education. She notes that when Russia occupies a city or town, one of the first things it does is forcibly replace the curriculum with one that is in line with a Kremlin agenda of erasing Ukrainian history while teaching children to identify with Russia. Read more: Ukraine schools remain a key battlefront in fight for nation's future But if Kristin Bakke’s surveys are anything to go by, this might prove as futile as Putin’s aim to prevent Ukraine from moving ever closer to the west and Nato.

            "In a world getting used to extreme weather, 2023 is starting out more bonkers than ever and meteorologists are saying it’s natural weather weirdness with a bit of help from human-caused climate change. Much of what’s causing problems worldwide is coming out of a roiling Pacific Ocean, transported by a wavy jet stream, experts said. At least one highway in drought-mired California looked more like a river because of torrential rain from what is technically called an atmospheric river of moisture. New Year’s brought shirtsleeve weather to the U.S. East and record high temperatures to Europe as the Northern Hemisphere on Wednesday was more than 2.6 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) hotter than the late 20th century average. And this is after frigid air escaped the Arctic to create a Christmas mess for much of the United States. [time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”] “All the ingredients are in place for two weeks of wild weather especially in the Western U.S.,” private meteorologist Ryan Maue said in an email. Maue said the big driver is a three-year La Nina—natural temporary cooling of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that alters world weather patterns—that just won’t quit. It is creating literal waves in the weather systems that ripple across the globe. And on certain parts of the waves are storms where the atmospheric pressure drops low and quickly, called bomb cyclones, that are quite wet, and they travel on atmospheric waves that transport the weather called the jet stream. Read more: ‘Bomb Cyclone’ and Other Weird Weather Words for Our Climate Change Era The jet stream now is unusually wavy, said Maue and Woodwell Climate Research Center climate scientist Jennifer Francis. The storms dip over the warm subtropics “and create a conveyor belt of of moisture to strafe the West Coast of the U.S,” Maue said. “I’d describe the jet stream and bomb cyclones as a runaway Pacific freight train loaded with moisture,” said Maue, former chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Trump administration. “Climate change adds more fuel to the locomotive engine.” More than 5 inches of rain fell on Saturday in the Sacramento area and California braced for bigger storms Wednesday and Thursday. As of Wednesday, snowpack was third highest in 40 years, more than 170% of normal. In addition to La Nina, a different natural temporary weather event called the Madden-Julian Oscillation enhances storms in the western Pacific, Maue said. Francis points to a “blob” of warm sea water off the Aleutian Islands, a phenomena that is happening more often, and a ‘’crazy warm” Arctic—Wednesday it was 5.8 degrees (3.2 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1979-2000 average—as part of what’s juicing up the Pacific. And with a wavier than normal jet stream, extremes of all kinds go up and down and around the planet, Francis said. “You can think of it like a jump rope. When you start to flick it at one end, that ripple goes through the whole jump rope eventually,” Francis said Wednesday. “And so it could be that the waving as such, being perhaps driven in the Pacific, could be accentuating it also over Europe.” A weather station in Delemont, Switzerland, on the French border, smashed its January record with an average daily temperature of 18.1 degrees Celsius (nearly 65 Fahrenheit) on the first day of the year. In Bucharest, Romania, on Tuesday it broke a January record at 17.2 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) and it was 17.9 degrees Celsius (64.2 Fahrenheit) in the Russian Republic of Dagestan, according to extreme weather tracker Maximiliano Herrera. Swiss weather service MeteoSuisse quipped on its blog: “… this turn of the new year could almost make you forget that it’s the height of winter.” This extreme weather has “a silver lining,” especially with the record heat in Europe in January easing winter heating fuel crunches caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Colorado meteorologist Bob Henson of Yale Climate Connections. And California, where there’s been a more than 20-year megadrought that worsens wildfires, is getting much-needed rain and snow — too much of it, actually. Roads and levees in California were washed out early in the week. Schools were closed Wednesday in the San Francisco area as more than 8,000 sandbags were given out in anticipation of extensive flooding. Flights were cancelled. “Excessive rainfall over already saturated soils will result in rapid rises on creeks, streams and rivers as well as flooding in urban areas,” forecasters said in a report. Except for the impressive record heat in Europe, “which is yet another example of the manifestation of human-induced climate change,” Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini said he finds nothing too unusual. Weather is naturally extreme “so the recent events we’ve been seeing can occur naturally,” said Weather Underground co-founder Jeff Masters now at Yale Climate Connections. “But with the disruption to global weather patterns that climate change is bringing the probability of seeing unusual weather events in any season increases.”\n",

Just make the call, I’m begging you.” Phil walked away and revealed Keeble agreed – and that she called off her fake witness, saving Billy from life behind bars. He told Keanu to take her to a hospital for treatment – and after Kat insisted that he drop his vendetta against him – he let him return to Walford. Back in the Square, Phil found himself confronted by Honey. “That was the last time you put my Billy on the line,” she told him. “Have you any idea of what you’ve put my family through, the pain, the fear? Billy might take it but I’m warning you Phil, I’m not scared of you.\\xa0 “And if I have to take you on then I will because I will protect my family until there’s not one breath left in my body.” Reeling from the confrontation with Honey, Phil went home and Kat was left to deal with. She raged at Phil for putting her and her boys in danger. In a rare display of emotion, Phil was in tears as he told Kat that she means everything to him – and he begged her to stay. Meanwhile in the hospital, Keanu listened in as Keeble kept to her promise and pretended she had no idea who shot her. But viewers aren’t impressed. One wrote: “Keeble doing the right thing – wonders never cease.” A second said: “After all that, all Keeble and Phil needed was a cuppa tea and a deep meaningful conversation.” But others were glad to see the back of Keeble, with one writing: “It’s finally over.”\""
